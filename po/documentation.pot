"your MySQL client library can be checked in your phpinfo() output. In "
"general, it should have at least the same minor version as your server - as "
"mentioned in :ref:`faq1_17`. This problem is generally caused by using MySQL "

"The field 'Transformation options' is a free-type textfield. You have to "
"enter transform-function specific options here. Usually the transforms can "
"operate with default options, but it is generally a good idea to look up the "
"overview to see which options are necessary. Much like the ENUM/SET-Fields, "
"you have to split up several options using the format 'a','b','c',...(NOTE "
"THE MISSING BLANKS). This is because internally the options will be parsed "
"as an array, leaving the first value the first element in the array, and so "
"forth. If you want to specify a MIME character set you can define it in the "
"transformation\\_options. You have to put that outside of the pre- defined "
"options of the specific mime-transform, as the last value of the set. Use "
"the format \"'; charset=XXX'\". If you use a transform, for which you can "
"specify 2 options and you want to append a character set, enter \"'first "
"parameter','second parameter','charset=us-ascii'\". You can, however use the "
"defaults for the parameters: \"'','','charset =us-ascii'\"."
