"You tried to access MySQL with an old MySQL client library. The version of "
"your MySQL client library can be checked in your phpinfo() output. In "
"general, it should have at least the same minor version as your server - as "
"mentioned in :ref:`faq1_17`. This problem is generally caused by using MySQL "
