"The field 'Browser transformation' is a drop-down field. You can choose from "
"a hopefully growing amount of pre-defined transformations. See below for "
"information on how to build your own transformation. There are global "
"transformations and mimetype-bound transformations. Global transformations "
"can be used for any mimetype. They will take the mimetype, if necessary, "
"into regard. Mimetype-bound transformations usually only operate on a "
"certain mimetype. There are transformations which operate on the main "
"mimetype (like 'image'), which will most likely take the subtype into "
"regard, and those who only operate on a specific subtype (like 'image/"
"jpeg'). You can use transformations on mimetypes for which the function was "
"not defined for. There is no security check for you selected the right "
"transformation, so take care of what the output will be like."

"The field 'Transformation options' is a free-type textfield. You have to "
"enter transform-function specific options here. Usually the transforms can "
"operate with default options, but it is generally a good idea to look up the "
"overview to see which options are necessary. Much like the ENUM/SET-Fields, "
"you have to split up several options using the format 'a','b','c',...(NOTE "
"THE MISSING BLANKS). This is because internally the options will be parsed "
"as an array, leaving the first value the first element in the array, and so "
"forth. If you want to specify a MIME character set you can define it in the "
"transformation\\_options. You have to put that outside of the pre- defined "
"options of the specific mime-transform, as the last value of the set. Use "
"the format \"'; charset=XXX'\". If you use a transform, for which you can "
"specify 2 options and you want to append a character set, enter \"'first "
"parameter','second parameter','charset=us-ascii'\". You can, however use the "
"defaults for the parameters: \"'','','charset =us-ascii'\"."
