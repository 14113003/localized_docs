"MySQL versions, you need to use the latest 2.x branch. phpMyAdmin can "
"connect to your MySQL server using PHP's classic `MySQL extension <http://"
"php.net/mysql>`_ as well as the `improved MySQL extension (MySQLi) <http://"
"php.net/mysqli>`_ that is available in PHP 5.0. The latter one should be "
"used unless you have a good reason not to do so. When compiling PHP, we "
"strongly recommend that you manually link the MySQL extension of your choice "
"to a MySQL client library of at least the same minor version since the one "
"that is bundled with some PHP distributions is rather old and might cause "
"problems see :ref:`faq1_17a`. `MariaDB <http://mariadb.org/>`_ is also "
"supported (versions 5.1 and 5.2 were tested). Since phpMyAdmin 3.5 `Drizzle "
"<http://www.drizzle.org/>`_ is supported."
