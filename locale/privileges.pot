msgid "User management is the process of controlling which users are allowed to connect to the MySQL server and what permissions they have on each database. phpMyAdmin does not handle user management, rather it passes the username and password on to MySQL, which then determines whether a user is permitted to perform a particular action. Within phpMyAdmin, administrators have full control over creating users, viewing and editing privileges for existing users, and removing users."

msgid "To create a new user, click the :guilabel:`Add a new user` link near the bottom of the :guilabel:`Users` page (you must be a \"superuser\", e.g., user \"root\"). Use the textboxes and drop-downs to configure the user to your particular needs. You can then select whether to create a database for that user and grant specific global privileges. Once you've created the user (by clicking Go), you can define that user's permissions on a specific database (don't grant global privileges in that case). In general, users do not need any global privileges (other than USAGE), only permissions for their specific database."
