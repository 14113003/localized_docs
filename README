phpMyAdmin - localized documentation
====================================

This repository contains localized documentation for phpMyAdmin.

To translate edit your language file in po directory, changes will be
propagated to generated documents. You can also translate online at
<https://l10n.cihar.com/projects/pmadoc/> and your changes will be merged to
SVN.



For manipulating with translations, you need gettext and po4a installed.

To start new translation you can use script admin/new-lang.

To regenerate documents use script admin/locales-update.

To obtain statistics about current translations run admin/locales-stats.
